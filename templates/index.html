          Professionally my focus is currently Big Data, ETL and the
          construction of data pipelines. Primarily this involves Python, Spark,
          Hadoop, Hive, SQL/HQL and some shell scripting. The team is beginnging
          to branch into agentic AI, currently dabbling in Google ADK.

          My personal pursuits do have some overlap with this. I am always
          trying to broaden my core foundations with Python and other languages.
          Lately, that has led me to experiment with Flask, the framework with
          which this site is being built. And like everyone else these days I
          have been captivated by the possibilities of AI. This has lead to some
          exploration of Google ADK, CrewAI and LangChain.

          Long ago, I stumbled into a basement game of Advanced Dungeons &
          Dragons at a friend's house — and it changed my life.
        </p>
        <p>
          Since then, I've played all manner of tabletop and digital
          role-playing games, along with a growing library of fantasy and sci-fi
          board games. There's something magical about collaborative
          storytelling and rolling dice with friends that never gets old.
        </p>
        <p>
          But nothing makes me feel more at home than a game convention. The
          energy, the creativity, the sense of community — it's my happy place.
          Whether it's demoing new games, diving into marathon sessions, or just
          nerding out with fellow fans, I always come away inspired and
          recharged.

          That is my beloved — and dearly departed — hound dog, Elvis.
        </p>
        <p>
          Our dogs have opened my eyes and my heart to animals of all kinds.
          What started as a simple companionship grew into a deep and lasting
          love that now feels like a defining part of who I am.
        </p>
        <p>
          Elvis, in particular, taught me patience, empathy, and the quiet
          strength of unconditional love. That bond changed me for the better,
          and it continues to shape how I see the world.

          <p>
            For several years, I flew freestyle regularly with a close friend
            and even got to attend Rotor Riot Rampage in 2023 — an epic
            multi-day FPV event.
          </p>
          <p>
            I never got especially good at it, to be honest. And while crashing
            is just part of the freestyle experience, the constant repair cycle
            started wearing me down. Still, I know I’ll come back to it — when
            it's fun, it's an absolute blast.
